# BART Text Summarizer

### Overview
A text summarization tool built with the **BART transformer model** (Facebook AI), using Hugging Face’s transformers library.  
The model takes long text as input and generates a concise summary (30–100 words), preserving the key points.  
This project was developed as part of a **Artificial Intelligence course**.  

### Why It’s Useful
Summarization helps students, professionals, and researchers save time by quickly extracting the main ideas from lengthy documents and articles.  

### How It Works
1. Input text is encoded by the BART model.  
2. The decoder generates the summary one token at a time, selecting the most important information.  
3. The final summary highlights the main points while keeping coherence and readability.
