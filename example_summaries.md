## Example 1

**Input text:** 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming industries around the world, from healthcare and finance to transportation and education. By using algorithms and data, AI systems can perform tasks that traditionally required human intelligence, such as recognizing images, understanding natural language, and making predictions. In healthcare, AI is helping doctors diagnose diseases earlier and more accurately, while in finance it assists in fraud detection and risk assessment. As AI technology continues to advance, it presents both opportunities and challenges, including ethical considerations, job displacement, and the need for transparent decision-making processes. Organizations are increasingly investing in AI research and development to stay competitive in a fast-changing world.

## Example 2

**Input text:** 
The Mars rover missions have provided scientists with valuable information about the red planet. Equipped with cameras, spectrometers, and other scientific instruments, these rovers have analyzed soil, rocks, and the atmosphere to search for signs of past water and potential microbial life. The data collected helps researchers understand Marsâ€™ geology, climate history, and its potential for supporting human exploration in the future. Each mission contributes to the broader goal of preparing for eventual human settlement on Mars.

**Summary:**
Mars has a diverse landscape with towering volcanoes, deep canyons, and polar ice caps. Scientists continue to study Martian soil, rock formations, and atmospheric conditions to determine whether microbial life could have existed in the past.

## Example 3

**Input text:**
Music has been an essential part of human culture for thousands of years, influencing emotions, traditions, and social interactions. From classical compositions to modern pop, music has the power to tell stories, convey feelings, and bring people together. Technological advancements, such as recording equipment, streaming platforms, and digital production software, have transformed how music is created, distributed, and consumed. Different genres and styles reflect cultural identities and historical periods, while collaborations between artists from diverse backgrounds foster innovation and cross-cultural exchange.
